        "As discussed in class neutral pions decay into pairs of photons and have an invariant mass of 0.135 GeV ([more information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion), also note that the *charged* pion weights slightly more and does not decay into two photons).  Neutral pions are typically measured by combining pairs of photons detected in a single event.  There is not tag saying that two particular photons came from a particular pion so all pairs are made and the [invariant mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass) of each pair is histogramed.  If the average number of pions in a particular event is $N$, then the average number of *pairs* in an event goes like $N^2$; so as $N$ increases the signal (number of photon pairs from a real pion) decreases relative to the background (photon pairs where each photon is from a different pion).  The signal pairs have an invariant mass that is peaked and can be described by a peak centered on 0.135 GeV and an area of $NxS$, where S is the total number of events. The background pairs have a broad distribution in invariant mass distribution without a peak.  The total distribution can  be described as the sum of these two distributions.\n",

This means that you create all possible pairs of photons within the same event and you do this for each event.  If the event contains 4 photons there are six photon pairs: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, BC (the order doesn't matter).  Two of these pairs are from real pions and 4 are combinatoric.  If you have 1000 events with 4 photons each, you have 2000 real photons and 4000 combinatoric pairs.
