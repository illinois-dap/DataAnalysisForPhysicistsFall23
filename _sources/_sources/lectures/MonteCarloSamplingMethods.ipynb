Sometimes, only the mode of a probability distribution is of primary interest. In this case, it's obtained by numerical optimization so full sampling is not necessary.\n",

[Inverse transform sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling) is an elementary method to sample from probability distributions, but requires the cumulative distribution function, which in turn requires knowledge of the, generally unknown, normalization constant. Now in principle, you could just obtain the normalization constant by numerical integration, but this quickly gets infeasible with an increasing number of dimensions. [Rejection sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling) does not require a normalized distribution, but efficiently implementing it requires a good deal of knowledge about the distribution of interest, and it suffers strongly from the curse of dimensionality, meaning that its efficiency decreases rapidly with an increasing number of variables.

It was proposed in 1953 by Edward Teller, Nicholas Metropolis, and others at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico during the early days of scientific computing. Teller and his physics colleagues were interested in using MCMC to calculate the thermodynamic properties of a weakly interacting classical gas, which was very difficult to calculate analytically. Impressively, more than half a century after its introduction, Metropolis MCMC is still in wide use today in many areas of science, engineering, and statistics."
