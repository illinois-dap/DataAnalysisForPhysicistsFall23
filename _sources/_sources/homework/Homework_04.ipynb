        "The Large Hadron Collider (and all colliders) operate by colliding bunches of ions together (a bunch at the LHC contains more than $10^{11}$ protons).  Each proton has a very small change of hitting another one so we can think of each potential collision as independent.  Let's say that for a given setup of the LHC the average number of collisions per bunch is $\\mu$.  Write a function that determines the probability of more than one collision per bunch crossing *in the case that there is at least one collision*."

        "In class, we discussed the error on the mean of a distribution.  Determining the error on higher order moments can be difficult.  A common technique is bootstrapping.  This essentially determines the error from subsamples of the data (we will talk more about these techniques later).  scipy has a nice functions for this.  Write a function that takes in an array of values and an order of a moment $n$ and determines the error on that moment.  Verify that the function works as expected for the mean by generating random samples according to a Poisson distribution of sizes 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and make a plot comparing the expected standard deviation to that from the bootstrapping method."

        "A colection of relativistic particles from a nuclear collision at the LHC are measured.  They are all created at the origin of the coordinate system and can be described by the angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ (the usual angles from spherical coordintates) and their energy $E$ and momenta $p$.  Write a function to determine each of the pairwise correlation coefficients between these four quantities.  Rank the pairs of quantities by the strength of their correlations.
